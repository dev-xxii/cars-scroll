          <p>
            This limited-edition coupe from Aston Martin was capped at 77 units,
            though after an accident in Asia, only 76 examples remain.

          <p>
            The Valkyrie, or AM-RB 001 as it was known in development, is a
            fantastically wild-looking hypercar.

          <p>
            Inspired by the Molsheim manufacturer’s Vision Le Mans concept,
            Bugatti’s Bolide combines its fantastical X-themed design language
            with the brand’s unprecedented W-16 power plant to yield an
            estimated top speed in excess of 311 mph.

          <p>
            The top spot for the world’s fastest supercar goes to Bugatti. In
            2019, pilot Andy Wallace railed a tweaked-version of the 1,600 hp,
            8.0-liter quad-turbocharged Chiron Super Sport around the
            Ehra-Lessien track.

          <p>
            Just about any Bugatti will make the cut among the world’s fastest
            production cars, if simply because the quad-turbo W-16 engine, first
            pioneered by the Veyron, established an entirely new era of
            four-figure horsepower output back in 2005.

          <p>
            Here’s yet another Bugatti, this one built back in 2010 for the sole
            purpose of securing the accolade of fastest production car ever
            built.

          <p>
            Gordon Murray served as designer of the McLaren F1, which set new
            standards for performance with a world-beating top-speed run of
            240.1 mph in 1998.

          <p>
            Hennessey Performance Engineering’s Venom F5 picks up the baton from
            its older sibling and rockets away. A 6.6-liter twin-turbo V-8 pumps
            out 1,817 hp and 1,193 ft lbs of twist, which propels the
            2,950-pound coupe to 60 mph in under two seconds.

          <p>
            John Hennessey’s eponymously named performance group is obsessed
            with power and speed, evidenced by shoehorning as much oomph as it
            can into production cars from other manufacturers.

          <p>
            In November of 2017, a Koenigsegg Agera RS, running E85 fuel
            (meaning it was getting 1,360 hp), was driven by a factory driver to
            a two-way average speed of 277.8 mph on an 11-mile strip of closed
            road in Nevada.

          <p>
            The second hypercar from the Swedish automotive wizards to grace our
            list is referred to as a “mega GT” by founder Christian von
            Koenigsegg.

          />
          <p>
            The Swedish manufacturer’s 5.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 engine is mated
            to a novel Light Speed gearbox that can handle its prodigious
            output, which can reach 1,600 hp when running on E85 biofuel.

          <p>
            As the “Ultimae” moniker denotes, Lamborghini’s latest Aventador
            represents the pinnacle performance variant of an impressive
            supercar chassis that first debuted back in 2011.

          <p>
            The rear-wheel-drive Speedtail employs a hybrid system good for
            1,035 hp, and its sleek shape and lightweight carbon-fiber
            construction is tailor-made for its top speed of 250 mph.

          <p>
            The successor to the game-changing Zonda, the Huayra comes from
            Italian speed master Horacio Pagani and is named after Huayra-tata,
            a Quechua wind god—fitting, considering the 720 hp coming from a
            twin-turbocharged Mercedes-AMG V-12.

          <p>
            Porsche did some light sandbagging when it claimed the top speed on
            its 918 model was 214 mph. In 2018, one 918 Spyder was recorded
            clocking 218.4 mph.

          <p>
            With twice the power of a Formula 1 car, the ability to hit 60 mph
            in under two seconds and a $2.4 million sticker price, the new Rimac
            Nevera should intimidate even an experienced hypercar owner.

          <p>
            In October of 2020, SSC North America’s founder Jerod Shelby took
            his latest hypercar to a Nevada desert and hammered out a run that
            was touted to have averaged 316.11 mph.
